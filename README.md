# COVID-Analysis

This project utilizes COVID-19 data from the WHO from 2020 to 2021. I wrote up multiple queries to analyze the dataset, like the relation between total cases and deaths, countries and regions most affected, and more. I also created a Tableau dashboard for an interactive visualization into the data that I was exploring, which includes a bar chart, table, geographic map, and line plot with projections for future COVID-19 cases.
